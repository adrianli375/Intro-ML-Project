# Intro-ML-Project

This repo is a project (tutorial) on some introductory machine learning projects, with some Jupyter Notebooks attached. 

In the docs folder, this project shows some demo on how to use git, and some testing libraries. 

In the demo folder, this project shows a demonstration example on applied machine learning projects. 

**Demo 1** is about building a machine learning classifier using libraries in `scikit-learn`. 

**Demo 2** is about building a regressor using libraries in `scikit-learn`. 

**Demo 3** is about building a classifier with text features using Bag-of-Words representation and pre-trained models in NLP. 

**Demo 4** is about using time-series models to forecast foreign exchange prices. 

**Demo 5** is about using time-series models and using LSTM (a kind of neural network) to forecast gold futures prices. 

**Demo 6** is about using the MNIST dataset to classify handwritten digits, using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). 

**Demo 7** is about attempting to classify images that are taken indoors vs outdoors, using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN).
