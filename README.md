# Test-Project

This repo is a test project. 

In the docs folder, this project shows some demo on how to use git, and some testing libraries. 

In the demo folder, this project shows a demonstration example on applied machine learning projects. 

**Demo 1** is about building a machine learning classifier using libraries in `scikit-learn`. 

**Demo 2** is about building a regressor using libraries in `scikit-learn`. 

**Demo 3** is about building a classifier with text features using Bag-of-Words representation and pre-trained models in NLP. 

**Demo 4** is about using time-series models to forecast foreign exchange prices. 

**Demo 5** is in progress, and it is about using time-series models (and possibly deep learning models) to forecast gold futures prices.
